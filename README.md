#Library Management System

##Overview
This Library Management System (LMS) is designed to efficiently manage library books inventories using a Binat Search Tree (BST)
for optimized book searching, insertion and deletion. The system provides a simple, text-based user interface for library staff to easily manage the books, track availability, and handle check-ins and check-outs.

## Features
- **Book Insertion** : Add new books to the system with the details like ISBN, Title, Author and Genre.
-  **Book Deletion** : Remove books from the system using their ISBN.
-  **Book Searching** : Search for books by ISBN, title or author to check their availability.
-   **Check-in/Check-out** : Manage book lending processes to track books lent out to patrons and those returned.
-   **List Books** : Display a complete list of books in the library catalog in an ordered manner.

## Technology
The system is implemented in C, utilizing a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient data management. The choice of C ensures the program runs efficiently with minimal overhead.
